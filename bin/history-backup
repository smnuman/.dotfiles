# This script creates monthly backups of the bash history file. Make sure you have
# HISTSIZE set to large number (more than number of commands you can type in every
# month). It keeps last 200 commands when it "rotates" history file every month.
# Typical usage in a bash profile:
#
# HISTSIZE=90000
# source ~/bin/history-backup
#
# And to search whole history use:
# grep xyz -h --color ~/.bash_history.*
#

KEEP=200											# number of histories to keep in the .bash_history
BASH_HIST=~/.bash_history							# history file name
BACKUP=$BASH_HIST.$(date +%y%m) 					# name of history_backup file with appended date-time info

if [ -s "$BASH_HIST" -a "$BASH_HIST" -nt "$BACKUP" ]; then
	# history file is newer then backup
	if [[ -f $BACKUP ]]; then
		# there is already a backup
		\cp -f $BASH_HIST $BACKUP
	else
		# create new backup, leave last few commands and reinitialize
		mv -f $BASH_HIST $BACKUP
		tail -n$KEEP $BACKUP > $BASH_HIST
		history -r
	fi
